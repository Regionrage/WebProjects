            <p id="desc">The journey of Sunbic University began on 29 January, 1965, created by the two founders, 
            Prof. Dr. Alexander Nicholas, MM and Prof. Dr. Klein Andersen, MEc. 
            The university had only been advancing ahead since then, 
            starting from a single building and 2 courses of teaching, 
            until the present day, with over 10 university building in total, 
            and over 20 courses being taught in the university.</p>

            <p id="desc">Starting with nothing but a simple short-term course in simple management course, 
            Sunbic started with the name "Sunny Business Course",
            with both of the founders being the only teachers there. 
            As time pass by, more and more people started joining in the course,
            and with the increasing demand, 
            the two founders decided that they need to start expanding their expertise, 
            and also start to expand in other directions, 
            such as adding more courses, hiring more suitable teachers, and more.
